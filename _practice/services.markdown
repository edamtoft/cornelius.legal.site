The Law Office of Linda Cornelius is committed to providing legal services to the diverse Spanish speaking communities in Maryland, regardless of the immigration status, income level, sexual orientation, or gender identity of our clients.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \* &nbsp; &nbsp; \* &nbsp; &nbsp;\*

We offer our services in Spanish and English. &nbsp;We know that it is important that you fully understand all aspects of your case. &nbsp;We will explain legal language in clear terms. &nbsp;Our team has the experience and knowledge to talk with you about the details of your case.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \* &nbsp; &nbsp; \* &nbsp; &nbsp;\*

We know that legal services are a major expense for many families. We accept payment over time, and &nbsp;in most cases we can tell you at the first appointment what your cost for representation will be.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \* &nbsp; &nbsp;\* &nbsp; &nbsp; \*

We take pride in offering our services to the LGBTQ community. Our legal services include name change, gender identification change, wills and powers of attorney, claims of asylum based on discrimination or gender identity, and other civil law cases in Maryland.

My commitment &nbsp;is to provide effective representation in court and helpful legal advice &nbsp;at a fair cost. l work with my clients to make these services affordable, including working out payment plans. In most cases I am able to tell you what the cost of the representation will be at the end of our first consultation, so you do not have costs you didn't expect.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \* &nbsp; &nbsp; \* &nbsp; &nbsp;\*

We offer our services in Spanish and English. &nbsp;We know that it is important that you understand all aspects of your case. We want you to have culturally competent translation of legal language, and full explanations of all aspects of your case.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; \* &nbsp; &nbsp; \* &nbsp; &nbsp;\*

We offer our services to the whole community, and take pride in having broad experience serving the LGBTQ community. Our services include name change, gender identification change, wills and powers of attorney, claims of asylum based on discrimination or gender identity, and other civil law cases. We are pleased to be able to offer legal services in Spanish to the LGBTQ community in Maryland.

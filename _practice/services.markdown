I worked for ten years in Legal Services offices in Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia, and Illinois that provided free legal help to low income people, and I take part now in clinics to provide legal help pro bono…because as an attorney I know that having access to legal assistance and a lawyer when you go to court is important.

I have been admitted to practice law in three tribal courts, (the court of the Bay Mills Indian Community and the court of the Sault Sainte Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan and the Court of the Mille Lac Band of Ojibwas in Minnesota), and I worked closely with tribal attorneys and tribal officials to make the justice system work for indigenous people in Michigan and Minnesota…because I believe that the legal rights of indigenous people are important.

I successfully challenged a law prohibiting marriage for certain disabled people in Michigan and fought discriminatory evictions and expulsions on behalf of disabled people in Michigan and Minnesota…because I believe that disabled people’s rights are important.

I spent the cold election day of 2012 standing outside a polling place handing out flyers to urging voters to vote YES on same sex marriage in Maryland, and I went to Annapolis to lobby my representative to vote to ban discrimination based on gender identity…because I believe in the rights of the LGBTQ community .

I joined the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU, in 1974, and I volunteered in their office in Minnesota during the summer of 1978. I have supported the ACLU since 1974…because I believe that freedom of speech and freedom of religion are important.

I have represented many women who were in violent marriages or relationships, and who needed legal help to leave those relationships, and I served on the Board of Directors for Domestic Violence programs in two states…because I believe that being able to choose to leave a violent relationship &nbsp;is important.

As your attorney, I bring all my experience, my experience in the community and my experience in court and practicing law, to your case.

We offer our services in Spanish and English.  We know that it is important that you fully understand all aspects of your case.  We will explain legal language in clear terms.  Our team has the experience and knowledge to explain the details of your case.

We know that legal services are a major expense for many families. We accept payment over time, and  in most cases we can tell you at the first appointment what your cost for representation will be.
